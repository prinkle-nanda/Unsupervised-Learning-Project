# Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my PGP in AI & ML from Great Learning. It explores unsupervised learning techniques, focusing on clustering methods such as K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering. The project covers data preprocessing, outlier detection, missing value imputation, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and cluster evaluation.

# Key Objectives
  * Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
  * Preprocess the data, handle missing values, and apply feature engineering.
  * Implement and compare Unsupervised Learning models:
      - K-Means Clustering
      - Hierarchical Clustering
      - Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE)
  * Evaluate clustering quality using Silhouette Score and Elbow Method.
  * Visualize cluster distributions and derive insights.
  * Apply Outlier Detection & Handling techniques to improve data quality.
  * Perform Missing Value Imputation to ensure data completeness.
  * Derive insights and share comparison
